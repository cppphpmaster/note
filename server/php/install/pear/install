Getting and installing the PEAR package manager
Windows
After you have downloaded and installed PHP, you have to manually execute the batch file located in e.g. c:\php\go-pear.bat. Alternatively, download https://pear.php.net/go-pear.phar with your browser and save the output to a local file named go-pear.phar. You can then run

      
php go-pear.phar
      
     
in a Windows Command Prompt to start the installation.

The setup will ask you some questions and afterwards the PEAR Package Manager will be installed in the path, which you have specified during installation.

Finally you have to add that installation path to your PATH environment. Either do this manually (Start > Control Panel > System > Environment) or run (double-click) the newly generated PEAR_ENV.reg that's now found in the PHP source directory.

After that you can access the PEAR Package Manager by running the command pear in a Windows Command Prompt.

After changing php.ini, you will need to restart your web server.

Now check that PEAR works.

Unix/Linux/BSD
When using PHP, the PEAR Package Manager is already installed unless one has used the ./configure option --without-pear.

If one uses a version of PHP that is supplied by Unix/Linux/BSD distributors it may be necessary to manually install PEAR. Users should consult the documentation for the respective distribution in this case.

If you want to re-install the Package Manager, you can use the following provisional way:

      
$ wget http://pear.php.net/go-pear.phar
$ php go-pear.phar
      
     
Please note, you may need to install the wget package via your Unix/Linux/BSD package manager. On Debian and Ubuntu this is done via:

      
      $ sudo apt-get install wget
      
     
Alternatively, download the go-pear.phar file via your browser.

If the process just exits without any output, your syslog will probably contain the following lines:

suhosin[4705]: ALERT - Include filename ('phar://go-pear.phar/index.php')
 is an URL that is not allowed
 (attacker 'REMOTE_ADDR not set', file '/root/go-pear.phar', line 1236)
     
To work around this problem, enable the phar in /etc/php5/conf.d/suhosin.ini:

suhosin.executor.include.whitelist = phar
     
Now check that PEAR works.

Mac OS X
Use curl as shown below to download the go-pear.phar file or just download the go-pear.phar file via your browser.

      
$ curl -O https://pear.php.net/go-pear.phar
$ php -d detect_unicode=0 go-pear.phar
      
     
You're now ready to configure PEAR for installation.

First you need to change the Installation Base.

So type 1, and then press Enter.

Enter /usr/local/pear

Press Enter.

Then, you will need to change the Binaries directory.

Type 4, and then press Enter.

Enter /usr/local/bin

Press Enter.

Once you have changed the Installation Base and the Binaries Directory, press Enter to install PEAR.

For a system-wide installation, you will need to execute the go-pear script with increased permissions. This is only recommended for advanced users.

       
$ curl -O https://pear.php.net/go-pear.phar
$ sudo php -d detect_unicode=0 go-pear.phar
       
      
Now check that PEAR works.

PEAR in hosting environments
If you are running your site at a web hosting provider with no direct access to the server (via local logins, Telnet or SSH), you can use the PEAR Installer using the Web Frontend or (S)FTP.

Go to go-pear and save as go-pear.php. Copy go-pear.php to your server and open the corresponding URL in your browser, for example http://example.com/pear/go-pear.php.

Do not forget to protect the pear directory if you did not do already before the installation: Make it unreadable and not executable from external (i.e. put it outside public_html).

Now check that PEAR works.
